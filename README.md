# Tic Tac Toe

This is an implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Ruby on the console. We created some console graphics for it, which give it a little bit Arcade era feeling to make things more interesting.

## Getting Started

First the game asks name from both players and player one starts the first round. Player one has 'X' marks on the table and player two has 'O' mark on the table as is seen below on the game table. Coordinate system and game table is built like shown below on the game table. So one can enter coordinates like - 'a1', 'a2', 'a3', 'b1', 'b2', 'b3', 'c1', 'c2', 'c3'. One coordinate on each turn. Game is won by player who is able to get three its marks on a straight line vertically, horizontally or diagonally. When one tries to give in coordinate, name or some other command, after writing your input one has to press enter! Happy playing!
